Virtual robot plan

Idea-
A thief that steals/collects “objects” and avoids “Robocop” 

Setting-
A city either random or a place (possibly Coventry).

Detection-
Possibility of an alarm to warn “Robocop” or “Robocop” line of sight.

Algorithm-
Find fastest route by defining the smallest distance between each “object” or the one farthest away from “Robocop” 

Punishment-
Once caught you lose an “object” or you have the opportunity to escape through an “assault course” and possibly sent to jail.
